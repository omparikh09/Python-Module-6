Q-3. Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.

ans:
    Operators :-
        Python provides various operators to perform some operations between two operends

        1. Arithmetic Operator :- 
            Use for mathematical operations.
            
            Example :-
                +(Addition), -(Subtration), *(Mulplication), /(Divition), %(Modules), **(Exponentiation), //(Flpor Divition)

        2. Comparison Operator :- 
            Used to compare values, returning True or False.

            Example :-
                ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

        3. Logical Operator :-
            Used to combine conditional statements.

            Example :- 
                and :- Return true if both conditions are true 
                or :- Retrun true if last one condition is true 
                not :- Reverses the result

        4. Bitwise Operator :- 
            Used for binary operations.

            Example :- 
                &, |, ^, ~, >>, <<
