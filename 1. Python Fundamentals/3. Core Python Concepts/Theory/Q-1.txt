Q-1. Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.

ans:
    Which types of value store in a variable it's called data types.

    1. Integers(int) :- 
        Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.

    2. Floats(float) :- 
        Represents real numbers or numbers with a fractional part.

    3. String(str) :-
        Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double or triple quotes.

    4. list :-
        Represents an ordered, mutable collaction of items. Lists can hold different types 
        of data(int, float, string, bool, etc.)

    5. Tuple :- 
        Represents an ordered, immutable collection of items. Once created, its elements cannot be changed.

    6. Dictionaries(dict) :- 
        Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and the associated value can be any data type.

    7. Set :- 
        Represents an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allows duplicate values.

    8. Bool :- 
        Represents boolean values, either True or False. Often used in conditional statements.
