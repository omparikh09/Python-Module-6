Q-3. Using loops with collections (lists, tuples, etc.).

ans: 
    You can loop through collaction like list, tuple, dictionaries and sets using for and while.

    1. Looping Through Lists :- 
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        for fruit in fruits:
            print(fruit)
    
    2. Looping Through Tuples :-
        Tuples work similarly to lists.

        colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
        for color in colors:
            print(color)
    3. Looping Through Dictionaries :-
        Use .items() to iterate over key-value pairs.

        person = {"name": "Om", "age": 22}
        for key, value in person.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")

    4. Looping Through Sets :- 
        Sets are unordered, but you can iterate over them.

        numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
        for num in numbers:
            print(num)
