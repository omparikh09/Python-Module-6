Q-1. How functional programming works in Python.

ans:
    Functional programming in python means writing code that focuses on functions.

    1. Functions as First-class Citizens :-
        You can assign functions to variables, pass them as arguments, or return them form another functions.

    2. Higher-Order Functions :-
        Functions that take other functions as arguments or return a function.
    
    3. Lambda Functions :-
        Small, unnamed functions defined with lambda.

    4. Immutable Operations :-
        Functional style avoids changing or mutating existing data structures.

    5. Other functions tools in python :-
        1. filter() :- 
            Lets you filter out items from a collection (like a list) that do not satisfy a condition.
        
        2. map() :-
            Applies a function to all items in a collection and transforms them into a new collection.
        
        3. readuce() :-
            Combines all elements of a collection into a single result, by applying a function repeatedly.
