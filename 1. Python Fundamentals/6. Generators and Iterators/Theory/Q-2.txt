Q-2. Difference between yield and return.

ans:
    1. Yield :-
        -> Converts a function into a generator.
        -> Can be called multiple times, resuming from the last state.
        -> Efficient, as it generates values one at a time.
        -> Ideal for iterators and large datasets.

    2. Retrun :- 
        -> Ends function execution and returns a value.
        -> Runs once, then exits.
        -> Stores all values in memory before returning.
        -> Used for single value returns.
