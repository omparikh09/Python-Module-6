Q-1. Understanding how generators work in Python.

ans:
    Generator is a special functions that return an iterator, allowing you to intrate over a values one at a time 
    instead of storing them all in memory. 

    How Generators Work :- 
    
    -> Generator function contain yield statements.

    -> When called, they return a generator object.

    -> Each call to next() resumes execution from the last yield.
